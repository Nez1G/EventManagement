A web solution made using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, JQUERY, AJAX, BOOTSTRAP and JAVA for the CUD interfaces, API and respective
webservice that allows you to manage different types of events. All the files names are in Portuguese because it was a project that I made to the 
university. The solution works great and it preforms functions like create, edit and delete events and their respective associated
activities like hire staff, police, firefighters, etc, rent material to use on the event, check the budget for the event, check for events
nearby the created event, and many many others.
